# Cellular Automata with custom rules

Inspired by [Conway's game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) and 
Wolfram's way of visualizing an automaton and its rule set (which I saw on [Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain)'s [Coding Challenge 179](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ggxt06qSAe4)).
